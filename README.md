# ADVENT OF CODE CHALLANGES

## Overview

This repository contains my challenges for each day. I avoided using AI tools or even Google to solve these challenges, all you can see is my personal logic. 
I am new to Python therefore I have decided that this is a great opportunity to learn. Each folder contains a python script and necessary inputs. 

## Note 

I will try to complete the entire advent using Python only.
